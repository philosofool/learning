# Learning

This is a repository of non-code stuff that I use to share across multiple computers. Feel free to browse my Coursera course notes and anything else you see here.

## newgroups

This contains a Jupyter Notebook to develop a classifier on 20newgroups that runs through some basic classification with the complete dataset.
- Using text extraction tools in scikit-learn
- Using gridsearch with pipelines to find strong model parameters.
- Comparing models for their test set strength and train time.
- Feature engineering to improve model strength (no successful features found...)

## notes

I'm saving notes from some Coursera classes here. Not all my classes have notebooks here. _The is no code for course assignments._ Sorry, but that sort of code sharing undermines us all.
