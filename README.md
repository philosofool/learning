# Learning

This is a repository of stuff that I use to share across multiple computers. It contains examples of what I'm working on to get better. Feel free to browse my Coursera course notes and anything else you see here.

## titanic

There's data set on Kaggle; the morbid goal is to predict survivors in the test set. As of 11/10/20, I scored in the 96.7th percentile with ~.799 accuracy. You can see the development of features and models in the .ipynb here.

## newgroups

This contains a Jupyter Notebook to develop a classifier on 20newgroups that runs through some basic classification with the complete dataset.
- Using text extraction tools in scikit-learn
- Using gridsearch with pipelines to find strong model parameters.
- Comparing models for their test set strength and train time.
- Feature engineering to improve model strength (no successful features found...)

## notes

I'm saving notes from some Coursera classes here. Not all my classes have notebooks here. _The is no code for course assignments._ Sorry, but that sort of code sharing undermines us all.
