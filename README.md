# Learning

This is a repository of stuff that I am currently or recently working on learning. (I also use it to share across multiple computers.)

## [titanic](/titanic)

There's [data set on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic); the morbid goal is to predict who will survive in the test set. As of 11/10/20, I scored in the 96.7th percentile with ~.799 accuracy. You can see the development of features and models in the [titanic.ipynb](titanic/titanic.ipynb).

## [newgroups](/newsgroups)

This contains a Jupyter Notebook [(link)](newsgroups/newsgroups.ipynb) to develop a classifier on [20Newgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) that runs through some basic classification with the complete dataset.
- Using text extraction tools in scikit-learn.
- Using gridsearch with pipelines to find strong model parameters.
- Comparing models for their test set strength and train time.
- Feature engineering to improve model strength (no successful features found...)

## [tf_keras](/tf_keras)

Learning to work with Tensorflow and Keras for machine learning. Starting out on [MNIST data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) from Kaggle.

## [notes](/notes)

I'm saving notes from some Coursera classes here. Not all my classes have notebooks here. _The is no code for course assignments._ Sorry, but that sort of code sharing undermines us all.
