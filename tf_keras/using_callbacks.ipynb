    "# Using Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Callbacks are an integral part of Keras. Callbacks are used to get performance information, log progress, halt in the event of errors, tune parameters, save model state (in case of crash, etc.), finish training once loss is minimized. The list goes on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching goal is to learn to use callbacks for some typical tasks. These include:\n",
    "- Reporting about training progress.\n",
    "- Stoping once training no longer reduces loss.\n",
    "- Tuning hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Implementing adaptive learning rate decay.\n",
    "- Finding an optimal batch-size for training.\n",
    "- Putting some of this into ```my_keras_utils.py``` so that they can be easily called and reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Here?\n",
    "\n",
    "I continue working with MNIST data, which I began working with in [my first Keras models](first_model.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "My **concrete objective** is to tune a model that does well on Kaggle: 97th percentile? That's tough, but I think I can make it work."
